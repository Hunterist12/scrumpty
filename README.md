Putting apps together again.

## Git workflow
Two branches: master and dev

1. Commit often and pull often.
2. When you want to work on feature, check out dev branch and make a new feature branch.
3. Do all work in feature branch. 
4. Before merging into dev, pull from dev branch and fix merge conflicts.
5. When merge conflicts are fixed, pull request into dev branch. 
6. Review.
7. Merge into dev.
8. If there is a functioning product in dev, merge into master.
